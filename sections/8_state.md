# Mutable State

We can change the state of something using:
- atoms
- refs
- agents

# Atoms

Atoms are designed to store the state of something that is
independent, meaning we can change the value of it independently
of changing any other state.

    (def who-atom (atom :caterpillar))
or 

    (def mlist-atom (atom '(1 2 3 4))

If we print the atom, we get a reference to the atom itself,
to get back the value stored by the atom we have to dereference
it by using the "@" symbol. For example:

    @who-atom
    ;; -> :caterpillar
    @mlist-atom
    ;; -> (1 2 3 4)


To change the state of an atom there are a couple of ways:
- reset!, just replace with another value
- swap!, replace with another value through a function


## Using reset!
One way is through the use of reset! which replaces
the old value with the new one. For example:

    (reset! who-atom :chrysalis)
    @who-atom
    ;; -> :chrysalis

## Using swap!

We can replace a value through the use of a function,
for example:

    (defn change [state]
        (case state
        :caterpillar :chrysalis
        :chrysalis :butterfly
        :butterfly))

    (swap! who-atom change)
    ;; -> :chrysalis



# Refs

We just saw that atoms were used for independent and synchronous state changes. What if
we have more than one thing that needs to change in a coordinated fashion? Take as an
example transferring money between two bank accounts. This is where Clojureâ€™s refs
come in. They allow this coordinated shared state. What makes them different from atoms
is that you need to change their values within a transaction. Clojure uses something called
software transactional memory (STM) to accomplish this. Refs use this STM to coordinate
changes of state.

Let's see an example:

    (def alice-height (ref 3))
    (def right-hand-bites (ref 10))

    ;; just as with atoms we can dereference them to get the value
    @alice-height
    ;; -> 3

We can use "alter" to change values of ref, this is equivalent to
"swap" with atoms, in the sense that alter takes a function and a
variable to change.

    (defn eat-from-right-hand []
    (dosync (when (pos? @right-hand-bites)
       (alter right-hand-bites dec)
       (alter alice-height #(+ % 24)))))

    (eat-from-right-hand)

We can changee refs only within a "dosync".
